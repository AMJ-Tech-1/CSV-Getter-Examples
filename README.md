# CSVGetter WordPress Components

Welcome to the **CSVGetter WordPress Components** repository! This collection of free, open-source WordPress widgets allows you to seamlessly integrate dynamic data from your CSVGetter endpoints into your WordPress sites. Use it to display and interact with data from Airtable, Notion, static CSV files, and more!

## About CSVGetter

[CSVGetter](https://csvgetter.com) is a powerful tool that lets users create API endpoints directly from various data sources like Airtable, Notion, or static CSV files. With CSVGetter, you can make your data accessible and dynamically updateable via simple JSON endpoints, allowing for a flexible way to work with data on websites and applications without needing to manually update each piece of content.

## Available WordPress Components

This repository includes four dynamic components that you can use to display data from CSVGetter endpoints on your WordPress site:

### 1. AccordionDropDown

A customisable accordion dropdown component that fetches data from your CSVGetter endpoint and displays it in an expandable/collapsible format. Ideal for FAQs, lists, or any data that youâ€™d like to display in an organised, easily navigable structure.

- **Features**: Dynamic item generation, expandable sections, customisable styling.
- **Use case**: FAQs, product specifications, detailed information lists.

### 2. ImageCarousel

A stylish image carousel that allows users to navigate through images pulled from their CSVGetter endpoint. This component is perfect for showcasing products, portfolios, or image galleries with additional details available on hover.

- **Features**: Slide transitions, customisable navigation buttons, dynamic data fetching.
- **Use case**: Product galleries, portfolios, travel images, and any image collection.

### 3. ImageGallery

An image gallery that pulls images and related information from your CSVGetter endpoint, displaying them in a grid format. Hovering over each image reveals more details, making it a great choice for visual collections that benefit from additional context.

- **Features**: Hover effects for additional information, responsive grid layout, dynamic image fetching.
- **Use case**: Art collections, product displays, real estate listings, photo galleries.

### 4. InfoCards

This component renders individual cards with images and relevant details, dynamically generated from the data in your CSVGetter endpoint. Each card displays a title, image, and essential details, making it a flexible solution for displaying summaries or previews.

- **Features**: Responsive card layout, image integration, auto-generated content based on endpoint data.
- **Use case**: Team bios, product summaries, service highlights, event previews.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Add Your CSVGetter Endpoint**: Each component includes an API URL variable where you should input your CSVGetter endpoint URL. Replace the sample URLs with your specific endpoint.
2. **Embed Components on Your Site**: Copy the HTML and JavaScript code for each component and paste it into the WordPress post, page, or widget where you'd like to display the data.
3. **Customise Styling**: Each component comes with a base style, but you can adjust the CSS as needed to match your siteâ€™s branding.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a sample of how you might set up the `InfoCards` component with your CSVGetter endpoint:

```html
<div id="card-container" class="card-container"></div>

<script>
	const apiUrl = "https://api.csvgetter.com/YOUR_ENDPOINT_HERE?type=json_records";

	fetch(apiUrl)
	  .then(response => response.json())
	  .then(data => {
		renderCards(data);
	  })
	  .catch(error => console.error('Error fetching data:', error));
  
	// Render function for InfoCards goes here...
</script>
```

Each component's code is designed to be plug-and-play, so you can quickly display data from your endpoint by adjusting the apiUrl variable.
